## Features

- **Object Detection:** Detects various objects in the camera frame.
- **Real-time Processing:** Provides instant feedback on detected objects.
- **Interactive Interface:** Displays the names of detected objects on the screen.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Main programming language for development.
- **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library):** Used for image and video processing tasks.
- **Other Libraries:**
